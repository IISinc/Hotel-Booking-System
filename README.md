# Hotel-Booking-System
A Java-based console application that simulates a simple hotel booking system.   The program allows users to view available rooms, make bookings, cancel reservations, and display booking details.
This project demonstrates a basic **hotel reservation system** using Java and object-oriented programming principles.  
It manages hotel rooms and bookings through user input via a menu-driven interface.

The system ensures that:
- Rooms cannot be double-booked
- Booking information is stored and displayed correctly
- Users can cancel existing reservations

# Features

- Book a room for a guest
- Cancel an existing booking
- View all current bookings
- Menu-driven console interface

# Concepts Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and objects
- Lists / collections
- Control structures
- User input handling
- Real-world system simulation
